                            <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", color: "grey" }}>
                                Flowers carry a lot of importance in our lives. In India, no worship of God is complete without some kind of flower. Devotees make a garland of flowers to dedicate it to God. In addition, we also use flowers for special occasions like weddings. <br /> <br />

                                The bride and groom wear garlands of flowers to signify their marriage. In addition, flowers smell so good that we use it in different places by planting them in our garden. This way, the beauty of our place enhances. <br /> <br />

                                Flowers carry importance in each nook and corner of the world. They also come in use for making medicines. Similarly, we also make difference in fragrance perfumes from the flowers. Further, the butterflies, birds and bees take the flowers as food. <br /> <br />

                                In many weddings, the bride carries a bouquet of flowers when she walks down the aisle. Thus, it is very symbolic in that sense. On special occasions of valentines and anniversary, we gift our partners’ beautiful flowers as a symbol of our love. <br /> <br />

                                Similarly, we send flowers for someone who is sick to brighten their day. We also send flowers as a token of condolence during funerals. Thus, we see they have so many uses in so many areas.

                            <h4>My Favourite Flower : </h4>
                            <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", color: "grey" }}>
                                My favourite flower is rose. I like other flowers too but I find the rose to be the most beautiful among all flowers. It is also called the king of flowers. They come in many colours so it offers great variety.<br /><br />

                                For instance, they are available in red, pink, white, yellow, blue and more. My favourite is the white rose. Even though the rose has small and sharp thorns on its stem, people love picking roses.<br /><br />

                                It looks beautiful when it blooms in the garden or is kept at the florist’s shop. Often we see the rose as a symbol of beauty and love. The rose has soft petals and a very sweet fragrance. It comes in use in many ceremonies for decorations purposes.<br /><br />

                                Moreover, garlands of roses are used in places of worship. Similarly, it is a great flower which always stands out from the rest of the flowers. I have planted roses in my garden as well with the help of my grandfather.
